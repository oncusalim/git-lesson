  #Task1:

  1. Open your Intellij and create new Java Project
  2. Name your 'git-lessons'
  3. Create a class called 'HelloWorld' under source
  4. Now instruct git to keep track of this project folder by enabling version control to create new local repository
        1. You can do this by going to top menu 'VCS' -> 'enable Version Control' and hit 'OK'
        2. 'VCS' option will turn into 'Git' from this point on.
        3.  From the 'Git' option click 'commit'
        4. It will open up tab on the left
            1. Select all the files you want to keep track of
            2.Enter commit message into the box right on top of commit button
            3. And hit commit
        5. if it's the first time, it will ask you to enter 'name and email'
             1. enter the name you desired
             2. enter the same email you used for Github.com account
        4. You will see success message on bottom left corner saying created git repository in xxxx location.
        5. If you see version not supported on bottom left corner
           1. click on configure link and click on next screen.

   5.Now do some more work (add some text anywhere)
        1. 'git' will see what has changed from last commit till now
        2. IntelliJ will also indicate with green bar on left for indication
        3. Now when we are ready to save this change into git repository, we can make our second commit same way we did previously

     git config --global  user.name "FIRST_NAME_LAST_NAME"
